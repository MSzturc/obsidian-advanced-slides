By using the `<grid>` tag you are able to layout the content of your slide in parts.

### Concept

Grid layouts drag-and-drop is used to size and position content of your slides. 

- **Drag** to size a block of content on your slide, then
- **Drop** to position that block anywhere on the slide.


### Basic Syntax

The following syntax is used to drag-and-drop a grid in Advanced Slides:

	<grid drag="width height" drop="x y">

The *width* and *height* values of the **drag** property define the  size of the area in which the content will be displayed. The *x* and *y* values ​​of the **drop** property define the position on the slide where the content should be inserted. 

{{%alert%}}By default, it is assumed that the values ​​are percentages based on the size of the slide. Append **px** to the values for pixel sizes.{{%/alert%}}

#### Position by Coordinates

Both positive and negative values can be set for *x* and *y* on the **drop** property. The meaning of positive and negative values in each case is summarized as follows:

- A positive x value indicates a position relative to the left edge of the slide.
- A negative x value indicates a position relative to the right edge of the slide.
- A positive y value indicates a position relative to the top edge of the slide.
- A negative y value indicates a position relative to the bottom edge of the slide.

The following sample slide helps to clarify these concepts:

```md
<grid drag="60 55" drop="5 10" bg="red">
60 x 55
</grid>

<grid drag="25 55" drop="-5 10" style=bg="green">
25 x 55
</grid>

<grid drag="90 20" drop="5 -10" bg="gray">
90  x 20
</grid>
```

#### Position by Name

Some common grid positions have been named for your convenience. Named positions can be used in place of *x* and *y* coordinates on the **drop** property. The following named positions are currently defined:

- center
- top
- bottom
- left
- right
- topleft
- topright
- bottomleft
- bottomright

The following sample slide helps to clarify these concepts:

```md
<grid drag="40 30" drop="topleft" bg="red">
Top Left
</grid>

<grid drop="right" bg="green">
Right with default size
</grid>

<grid drag="80 30" drop="bottom" bg="coral">
Bottom
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-basic2.png)

{{%alert%}}When drap property is not specified, grid component uses a default size of **50 100**{{%/alert%}}

### Flow

The following syntax is used to define a custom flow for a grid:

	<grid drag="width height" drop="x y" flow="col | row">

Using a value of **col** or **row** for the **flow** property defines the layout behavior for the grid. If the flow property is not specified then the grid automatically inherits the default *col* flow behavior.

#### Column Flow

When `flow="col"` the following layout and spacing behaviors occur within the grid:

- Children are rendered vertically within the grid
- An equal amount of space is injected between each child
- An equal amount of space is injected at the start and end of the grid

The following sample slide helps to clarify these concepts:

```md
<grid  drag="40 100" drop="center" bg="coral" flow="col">
Heading
![[Image.jpg]]
**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-flow1.png)

#### Row Flow

When `flow=row` the following layout and spacing behaviors occur within the grid:

- Children are rendered horizontally within the grid.
- An equal amount of space is injected between each child
- An equal amount of space is injected at the start and end of the grid

The following sample slide helps to clarify this concept. Note, the grid width here is 100% of the slide width:

The following sample slide helps to clarify these concepts:

```md
<grid  drag="100 40" drop="center" bg="coral" flow="row">
Left
![[Image.jpg]]
**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-flow2.png)

### Attributes

#### Background

The grid bg property is used to define a custom background for a grid. Children added to the grid are rendered on top of the background.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" bg="color">

Where the color option of the **bg** property takes any valid [CSS Color Value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). The following sample demonstrates color backgrounds:

```md
<grid  drag="55 50" drop="topleft" bg="orange">
### Make
</grid>

### Noise <!-- element drag="55 50" drop="bottomright" bg="rgb(0,0,0)"-->

<grid  drag="25 20" drop="center" bg="green" rotate="-15">
### some
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-bg.png)

#### Border

The grid border property is used to define a custom border for a grid section. Custom borders can help to highlight or differentiate grids on your slide.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" border="width style color">

Where the **width** option of the **border** property takes values of *thin*, *medium*, *thick* or a pixel value such as **10px**. The style option takes values of *dotted*, *solid*, *dashed*, *inset*, or *outset*. And the **color** option takes any valid [CSS Color Value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value).

The following sample demonstrates borders:

```md
<grid  drag="30 25" drop="left" border="thick dotted blue">
thick dotted blue
</grid>

<grid  drag="30 25" drop="center" border="4px solid white">
20px solid white
</grid>

thick dotted blue <!-- element drag="30 25" drop="right" border="medium dashed red"-->
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-border.png)

#### Animation

The grid animate property is used to define a slide animation a grid section. The animation applies to the grid and all associated children.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" animate="type speed">


Where the **type** option of the **animate** property can take one of the following animation types:

- fadeIn
- fadeOut
- slideRightIn
- slideLeftIn
- slideUpIn
- slideDownIn
- slideRightOut
- slideLeftOut
- slideUpOut
- slideDownOut
- scaleUp
- scaleUpOut
- scaleDown
- scaleDownOut

{{%alert%}}The **speed** option is optional. When specified it accepts a value of slower or faster.{{%/alert%}}

#### Opacity

The grid opacity property is used to control the transparency of a grid section. Adjusting the opacity of a section also affects the opacity of all associated children.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" opacity="level">


Where the **level** option of the **opacity** property can take any value from **0.0** to **1.0**. A grid section with an opacity value of 0.0 is invisible.

#### Filter

The grid filter property is used to define filter effects for a grid section. Filter effects on a grid section also affect all associated children.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" filter="effect">


Where the **effect** option of the **filter** property can take one of the following types:

- blur
- bright
- contrast
- grayscale
- hue
- invert
- saturate
- sepia

The following sample demonstrates filters:

```md
<grid  drag="50 50" drop="-12 -25" bg="white" filter="grayscale()">
![[Image.jpg]]
</grid>

Text is too blurry <!-- element drag="30 25" drop="5 15" bg="#B565A7" filter="blur(10px)" -->
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-filter.png)

#### Rotate

The grid rotate property is used to control the 2D rotation of a grid section. Rotation on a grid section also affect all associated children.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" rotate="deg">

Where the **deg** option of the **rotate** property is a postive or negative value indicates a degree of rotation from 0 to 360 degrees.

The following sample demonstrates rotation:

```md
<grid  drag="30 25" drop="12 15" bg="#B565A7" rotate="-10">
Hello
</grid>

World! <!-- element drag="40 25" drop="-12 -25" bg="#D65076" rotate="40" -->
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-rotate.png)

#### Padding

The grid **pad** property is used to define custom padding for grid. Custom padding can help to enhance the overall appearance of content by controlling the space around grid children.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" pad="top right bottom left">

Where the **top**, **right**, **bottom**, and **left** options on the **pad** property all take pixel size values. Following standard [CSS Padding Rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) these four options can also be specified with just two values or even a single value, for example:

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" pad="10px 15px">

This sample grid above would display with 10px padding top and bottom and 15px padding left and right. The following sample demonstrates padding:

```md
<grid  drag="50 50" drop="topleft" bg="orange" pad="0 50px">
###### Lorem Ipsum wasnt simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book here there
</grid>

<grid  drag="50 50" drop="bottomright" bg="orange" pad="20px">
![[Image.jpg|800]]
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-pad.png)

{{%alert%}}Padding introduced by this property does not increase the size of the grid itself. Rather it reduces the size of the area available to render children within the grid.{{%/alert%}}

#### Alignment

The grid **align** property is used to define the horizontal alignment of a grid section.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" align="type">

Where the **type** option of the **align** property can take one of the following types:

- left
- right
- center (default)
- justify / block
- top
- bottom
- topleft
- topright
- bottomleft
- bottomright
- stretch

The following sample demonstrates the use of align:

```md
<grid drag="35 20" drop="topleft" align="left">
This text is aligned to the left side of the box
</grid>

<grid drag="35 20" drop="topright" align="right">
This text is aligned to the right side of the box
</grid>

<grid drag="36 20" drop="center" align="justify">
Stretches the text so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and magazines)
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-align.png)


The following sample demonstrates the use of stretch alignment:

```md
<grid drag="100 45" drop="top" flow="row" align="stretch">
![[Title-Wide.png]]
![[Title-Wide.png]]
![[Title-Wide.png]]
</grid>

<grid drag="100 55" drop="bottom" flow="col" align="stretch">
![[Title-Wide.png]]
![[Title-Wide.png]]
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-stretch.png)


#### Justify Content

The grid **justify-content** property is used to define how the grid component distributes space between and around their children.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" justify-content="type">

Where the **type** option of the **justify-content** property can take one of the following types:

- start
- center
- space-between
- space-around
- space-evenly (default)
- end

The following sample demonstrates the use of align:

```md
<grid drag="30 100" drop="left" justify-content="center" bg="red">
Item 1
	
Item 2
	
Item 3
	
Item 4
</grid>

<grid drag="30 100" drop="center" justify-content="space-between" bg="green">
Item 1

Item 2
	
Item 3
	
Item 4
</grid>

<grid drag="30 100" drop="right" justify-content="space-around" bg="coral">
Item 1
	
Item 2
	
Item 3
	
Item 4
</grid>
```

![Example](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/images/grid-justify.png)

#### Fragments

The grid frag property is used to define fragments for grid. Fragments are used to highlight or incrementally reveal individual elements on a slide.

	<grid  drag="width height" drop="x y" frag="index">

Where the **index** option of the **frag** property is a postive value indicates the order the fragment will be displayed.

The following sample demonstrates fragments:

```md
<grid drag="60 55" drop="5 10" bg="red">
### Fragments:
+ Right
+ Bottom
</grid>

<grid drag="25 55" drop="-5 10" bg="green" frag="1">
Right Grid
</grid>

<grid drag="90 20" drop="5 -10" bg="gray" frag="2">
Bottom Grid
</grid>
```

As you have surely seen in the example, you can combine Fragments and [Fragment Lists]({{%relref "fragments.md"%}}) with each other. By default, Fragment Lists generate indexes that start at 1.
